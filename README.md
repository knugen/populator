# PHP Populator (Array-to-Object)

PHP Populator is a simple Array-To-Object library which transforms arrays into a given object with a few additions with Annotations.  
This is **not** a deserializer. If you're looking for a serializer/deserializer, I advise you to use [**jms/serializer**](https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer).

The simple goal of this library is to use a lightweight (still object oriented) solution to hydrate an object from a given array without the overkill of a full serializer.
